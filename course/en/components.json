Any overdraft facility should be arranged with your bank from the outset. If you use an unarranged overdraft or miss payments, this may damage your credit score.</p><p class=\"force-left-align\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\">On your business account, an overdraft sounds like a simple and easy option; once your account funds get below zero, you can still draw money by using your overdraft. This can be a convenient safety net for short-term cash flow issues, like paying immediate invoices. Your bank account will have an overdraft limit, this is the maximum amount you can borrow, and it set at an individual level.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">However, an overdraft, like a loan is not free, you still have to pay the bank back, and there will be interest to add on top. Once your balance is back over zero, you stop paying fees.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">There are both secured and unsecured overdrafts. The same as with a loan, if you have a secured overdraft, you will need to secure the loan to a business asset, this is usually a property or something of significant value.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\">If you have an unsecured overdraft, you do not need to risk any of your business assets. However, it is worth noting that the interest rates on these tend to be significantly higher.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><strong>Pros:</strong> An overdraft facility is often already built into your bank account. You don&#39;t have to convince the bank to lend you the money for a particular project. You can ask for the overdraft limit to be increased.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><strong>Cons:</strong> The interest rates can vary drastically. If you need a large overdraft limit, this often becomes &#39;secured&#39; so you have to risk your assets to borrow the money. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><strong>Further reading:</strong></p><ul><li class=\"force-left-align\"><a href=\"https://www.iwoca.co.uk/finance-explained/business-overdraft/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.iwoca.co.uk/finance-explained/business-overdraft/</a></li></ul>"},{"_hotspotType":"number","_shouldDisplayTextHotspotAsButton":false,"_textHotspotStyles":{"_fontColor":"transparent"},"_mobileTextHotspotStyles":{"_fontColor":"transparent"},"_textHotspotLayout":"center","_textHotspotWidth":50,"_mediaType":"image","_itemGraphicLayout":"right","_graphic":{"srcAdvanced":{"_setImagePerDeviceSize":false}},"_audio":{"_transcript":{"button":"Open transcript"}},"_video":{"_transcript":{"button":"Open transcript"}},"_left":23.407202216066477,"_top":14.727608494921515,"_mobileLeft":50,"_mobileTop":50,"body":"<p class=\"force-left-align\">In the excitement of launching or growing a new business, it may be tempting to ask for the financial assistance of friends and family. If your start-up is going well and showing promise, you may even find that friends and family will want to invest in helping you grow the business and reap some of the financial rewards with you.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">In many instances, family members going into business together can be a positive thing; for example, Go Ape, Specsavers and Jo Malone are all family-run businesses. In a survey from <a href=\"https://www.wrighthassall.co.uk/knowledge-base/mixing-business-and-family-a-recipe-for-disaster\">YouGov in 2013</a>, 44% of respondents said they&#39;d be more than happy to go into business with a family member, the main reason stated was trust.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">If this is a route you are looking to consider, there are a few things to bear in mind. It needs to be made clear and be documented, precisely, what the conditions of the loan are; is the family member buying a share of the business, or is it a loan with a fixed term and interest rate? Will the repayments start immediately or when your company has a set turnover or profit?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">It would be unwise from a business and personal point of view to rely on a chat over the dinner table to iron out the terms of the arrangement; it needs to be agreed and written down in detail with all parties signing. You don&#39;t need a lawyer to do this for you; there are templates you can use to outline the specifics.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><strong>Pros:</strong> Likely to be the most cost-effective way of borrowing money. You won&#39;t need the same level of detail and financial forecasting to secure the loan.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><strong>Cons:</strong> It&#39;s hard to walk away if the business fails, as you feel morally obliged to repay all the money you borrowed.

The money you borrow is paid directly into your bank account, at the end of the month, or on &#39;payday&#39; you repay the loan plus the interest. There are now other payday loan options and you can borrow money over a slightly more extended period, in the region of three months.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">However, the one thing that all these short-term loans have in common is extremely high-interest rates. The average annual percentage rate (APR) of these types of loans is 1,500% compared to a credit card with an average annual percentage interest rate of 22.8%.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">The FCA regulates payday loans; under the law, the cost is capped, so you will never have to pay back more than twice what you borrowed.

Peer-to-peer loans all happen through a peer-to-peer network or marketplace, where the platform matches people or businesses who need to borrow money to those willing to lend it. Unlike with a traditional loan, rather than borrowing from one source, peer-to-peer lending means you borrow from a group of people, and the peer-to-peer platform facilitates this &ndash; hence why it is sometimes referred to as a crowdfunding model.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">To access these funds for your start-up, you would need to register with one of the platforms. You will be asked to provide your business&#39;s financial details, turnover, profit, history, and statements as evidence; you&#39;ll also be asked what the loan will be used for. If you pass stage one of the process, your details will be released for potential investors to see on the platform, each of these investors could offer smaller amounts, which collectively add up to make the full loan amount requested.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Peer-to-peer loans can be used by almost any business or start-up needing help to raise finance. As with any loan, monthly repayments are put in place, the interest rates vary significantly with P2P lending, but it tends to be more favourable than more traditional means.</p><p class=\"force-left-align\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Please be aware, not all peer-to-peer business loans are unsecured. If you default on a peer-to-peer loan, the lender could pass the loan on to a debt collection agency which could affect your credit rating and limit your business if you require further investment.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Peer-to-peer platforms are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

There are undoubtedly many positives to using this approach.</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><a name=\"\"></a></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Still, start-ups must understand the different crowdfunding options and the impact each may have on their business finances. Crowdfunding, as the name suggests, involves a &#39;crowd&#39; or group of people who all invest in your business or idea.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">There are three types of crowdfunding arrangement:</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><h2 class=\"force-left-align\">Reward-based</h2><p class=\"force-left-align\">Reward-based crowdfunding is the type of crowdfunding most people are familiar with. It&#39;s the approach used by Kickstarter, Indigogo and many other crowdfunding platforms. The platforms each offer a slightly different approach, but as a rule, you &#39;pitch&#39; your idea or business via the platform to mini investors, they in turn pledge money to your idea or project, the pledges start from around &pound;5 or $5.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">The more people pledge, the higher the reward they receive in return, for example, a &pound;5 pledge, may get a thank you mention on social media, but a &pound;100 pledge might get a 10% discount on the product or service when it launches. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">This approach tends to attract mini investors rather than serious investors. Still, it is great for getting ideas and inventions off the ground and for giving you a customer base before your product even launches.</p><p class=\"force-left-align\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\">As part of your pitch, you have to specify the amount you are looking to raise to get your project started. On Kickstarter, you only get to access the pledges if your project reaches its financial goal. However, this is not the same across the board, so research the platform that best suits your requirements before you get started. It is also worth noting that each of the platforms takes a fee either on your project as a whole, or a transaction fee on the pledges.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Please be aware, reward-based crowdfunding is not regulated in the UK, EU or USA.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><h2 class=\"force-left-align\">Equity share</h2><p class=\"force-left-align\">Another, lesser-known form of crowdfunding follows the same principles as reward-based crowdfunding, but instead of being rewarded with discounts or early access, each of the investors takes some equity in the business. This, of course, means they will be financially rewarded if this business does well, but equally, if the company fails, they would lose their investment.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">For example, if you are willing to give away 20% equity in your business for &pound;100,000, then you may get one investor who gives you the full amount, or you may find many investors offer smaller amounts for a share of the 20% equity in the business.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">You could have ten investors all investing &pound;10,000 each and each owning 2% of your business. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">There are equity share crowdfunding platforms to facilitate this approach, for example, Crowdfunder and Seedrs.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">In the UK, equity-based crowdfunding is a regulated activity under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">In the US, like the UK, reward-based crowdfunding is unregulated, but equity-based crowdlending or crowd-investing must comply with the registration and prospectus requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><strong>Further reading:</strong></p><ul><li class=\"force-left-align\"><a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/crowdfunding\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/crowdfunding</a></li><li class=\"force-left-align\"><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-66119-3_9\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-66119-3_9</a></li></ul>"},{"_hotspotType":"number","_shouldDisplayTextHotspotAsButton":false,"_textHotspotStyles":{"_fontColor":"transparent"},"_mobileTextHotspotStyles":{"_fontColor":"transparent"},"_textHotspotLayout":"center","_textHotspotWidth":50,"_mediaType":"image","_itemGraphicLayout":"right","_graphic":{"srcAdvanced":{"_setImagePerDeviceSize":false}},"_audio":{"_transcript":{"button":"Open transcript"}},"_video":{"_transcript":{"button":"Open transcript"}},"_left":58.2409972299169,"_top":15.927977839335183,"_mobileLeft":50,"_mobileTop":50,"body":"<p class=\"force-left-align\">Peer-to-peer crowdfunding is also known as loan-based crowdfunding or debt-based funding. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulates it.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Peer-to-peer crowdfunding is more like a loan, but rather than a traditional loan from one lender, usually a bank, you borrow or crowd-borrow from a group of people. In the same way, other crowdfunding platforms work, these investors get to pick who they want to work with and invest in, and they agree on an interest rate that works for both parties. If the business cannot repay the loan, the investor loses out, but if the loan is repaid, the investor makes a return on their investment through the interest paid.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">The peer-to-peer approach works best for start-ups that are already generating some income so they can afford the monthly repayments.

However, that doesn&#39;t mean that this type of investment is out of reach for relatively new and early-stage companies.</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Venture capital funds tend to be invested in businesses with a strong potential for growth because of the product and/or the people driving the business. This type of investment is not just about the product; the entrepreneur driving the business is also key to securing this type of funding.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Many global brands utilised venture capital funding early on in their business, possibly the most well-known being Google and Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Venture capital investment gives you not only the financial assistance you need to help grow your business but also access to business advisers and mentors who have the experience and knowledge to open doors for you using their contacts and distribution networks. A venture capital fund is pooled money from many investors. The fund is invested and managed on their behalf.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">If you choose the venture capital funding route, it is worth noting that in most cases, the venture capitalist will require a percentage of the business in return for their investment, which will dilute the ownership of your business. In many cases, this can be a minority share, but the percentage varies greatly depending on the current value of the company, the projected value of the company and the investment required for further growth.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">To gain VC investment, you will have to pitch your business to a panel of business advisers. Before you get ready to pitch, think, research and understand exactly what the investors will be looking for from you as an entrepreneur and your business or idea. You need to understand your business model inside out; you need to be ready to answer questions around the type of business you are looking to grow, is it a lifestyle business or is the vision to grow it to become a public company? What is the short-term vision, and what are the steps you&#39;ll take to get there? What are your personal values, and how will those be reflected in the business? And what do you know about the marketplace and the competition?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">There are hundreds of investors to choose from. It&#39;s important to ensure you are pitching to the right ones, research their reputation and their current investment portfolio, it is unlikely they will invest if they have a direct competitor to your business already. However, they may already invest in companies that could complement or help your business grow; this would be a good indication that they understand the landscape you&#39;re trying to sell into.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">While researching the investment company, don&#39;t forget to look at and research the individuals you&#39;d potentially be working with, these people are smart, intelligent business people, and you need to build a rapport with them from the outset.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">However, don&#39;t go for information overload in your first pitch meeting. At this stage, you&#39;re looking to impress enough that you are invited back for a second meeting, but don&#39;t forget, this is a two-way approach, you need to feel comfortable with the people and the terms. If you don&#39;t or have any doubt, walk away and find investment elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Venture capital investment is regulated, however, since Brexit, the rules have been updated, so it is worth checking the latest legislation on &quot;<a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/333/contents/made\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Venture Capital Funds (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019</a>&quot; directly on the Government&rsquo;s website.</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><strong>Pros:</strong> Access to funding and experienced business entrepreneurs who have a vested interest in helping the business succeed.</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><strong>Cons:</strong> You will dilute the ownership of your business.</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><strong>Further reading:</strong></p><ul><li class=\"force-left-align\"><a href=\"https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/entrepreneurs-playbook-episode-01/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/entrepreneurs-playbook-episode-01/</a></li></ul>"},{"_hotspotType":"number","_shouldDisplayTextHotspotAsButton":false,"_textHotspotStyles":{"_fontColor":"transparent"},"_mobileTextHotspotStyles":{"_fontColor":"transparent"},"_textHotspotLayout":"center","_textHotspotWidth":50,"_mediaType":"image","_itemGraphicLayout":"right","_graphic":{"srcAdvanced":{"_setImagePerDeviceSize":false}},"_audio":{"_transcript":{"button":"Open transcript"}},"_video":{"_transcript":{"button":"Open transcript"}},"_left":63.91966759002769,"_top":23.776546629732227,"_mobileLeft":50,"_mobileTop":50,"body":"<p class=\"force-left-align\">An angel investor (or business angel) is a private investor; they tend to be high net worth individuals who provide funding from their own money to entrepreneurs, start-ups and early-stage businesses in return for a stake in the company.</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><a name=\"\"></a></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">The terms offered by angel investors tend to be more palatable than other forms of investment.

It is up to the individual investor how much money they are willing to invest, but in most angel investment deals, the investment is between &pound;10,000 and &pound;500,000. Larger deals are becoming more common using angel investment syndicates (a group of angels).&nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Angel investors tend to be successful business people, who, as part of their investment, offer guidance and support to start-ups to help the business grow.

It is possible to do this with all sorts of assets for your business, including commercial premises, machinery, fleets of vehicles and catering equipment. For lots of equipment, you have the option to rent the machinery for a set period and at the end of that period, you can upgrade, give it back or pay to own the equipment. Depending on the terms of your contract, this has benefits, as you are often not responsible for the equipment in terms of maintenance and servicing or fixing any issues that arise. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"force-left-align\"><br></p><p class=\"force-left-align\">Another alternative way to raise finance is to use any assets you already have.

It is a popular choice for small businesses because many equity-based funding options like angel investors or venture capital providers can consider start-ups too high risk.
